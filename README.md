# 52_Programming_Problems_and_Solutions
Solutions of The Problems of The Book "52 Programming Problems and Solutions" by Tamim Shahriar Subeen, Tahmid Rafi &amp; Tamanna Nishat Rini

I Strongly Declare That No Solution Has Been Taken From The Aforementioned Book (Because I Don't Have The Book). I Took Problems from Dimik OJ and Try To Solve The Problems Myself. Many Times I Needed To Use Resources from Internet. Most of Them are in English. I Used The Name of The Book As My Repository Name, Because Problems of Dimik OJ as well as of The Book are Exactly Same (Dimik OJ Contains More Problems Than The Book).
